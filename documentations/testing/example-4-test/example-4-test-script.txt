Example 4 Test Script

1) Server-side simulates the movement of 100 entities.

2) Every one second, the server sends the position of entity one by one to every client in TICK_RATE (10 times):
-> The total number of packets sent in one second will be described as a formular: one_second_sent = TICK_RATE * 100 * NUMBER_OF_PLAYERS
-> The total ones in one minute should be: one_minute_sent = 60 * one_second_sent

3) When a client connects to the server, each interval time (for instance: 20 seconds), it sends a request to the server. The message contains an entity's id and a randomized string with a fixed length (for instance: the length of 10).

4) The server will calculate and seek the list of neighbors of that entity id which is sent from the client. (A neighbor can be found by calculating the distance between 2 entities, if that range is less than a predefined value, for example, 100 pixels, they become neighbors).

5) The response packet accommodates: the current server's fps at the moment, a list of neighbors' id and the list of result reckoned by that string sent from the client.

6) The client evaluates the latency time by the method: the received packet time in milliseconds - the sent packet time in milliseconds.

7) At frequent times, the client will show up the average latency in milliseconds.
