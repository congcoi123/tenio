// To use this class outside. You have to 
// 1. Define it as a bean, either by adding @Component or use @Bean to instantiate an object from it
// 2. Use the @Autowire to ask spring to auto create it for you, and inject all the values.

// So, If you tried to create an instance manually (i.e. new JwtConfig()). This won't inject all the values. 
// Because you didn't ask Spring to do so (it's done by you manually!).
// Also, if, at any time, you tried to instantiate an object that's not defined as a bean
// Don't expect Spring will autowire the fields inside that class object.
